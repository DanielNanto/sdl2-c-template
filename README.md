# SDL2-c-template
This is a basic SDL2 template. It is written in C and uses Cmake.
<!-- # Installation WIP
There are several ways to set up your environment, but I will provide a few possible methods.  
I have provided an installation bash script that can be run in a terminal on
unix based systems, and msys2 mingw on Windows 11.
  ## Linux-GNU
  The following are required packages:
  * build-essential  
  * cmake  
  * libsdl2-dev  
  * libsdl2-image-dev  
  * libsdl2-mixer-dev  
  Alternatively, for your convenience, an installation script can be run using the following bash commands:  
  `$ chmod a+x install.sh`  
  `$ ./install.sh`  
  ## Windows
  N/a
  ## Mac OS
  N/a

# Scripts WIP
`valgrind ./build/sdl-cmake-template > log.txt 2>&1`   -->

*note: Search and replace "sdl2-c-template" within your project directory to 
rename your project.*  
*note: there are many commits in this repo for my convenience when testing on
several devices.*  
*note: bash scripts may need permissions on your system.*
*You may need to run the following commands:*  
`$ chmod a+x run.sh`  
`$ chmod a+x install.sh`
